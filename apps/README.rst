Custom Apps
===========

The module shows only custom apps to user. To use this feature, create some number of modules with prefix ``super_`` in technical name (e.g. super_pos, super_hr, etc). Then a user will be asked to work with applications from that list only and doesn't care about dozen of technical modules, which custom applications consist of.
